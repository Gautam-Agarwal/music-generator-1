#Music Generator
Iâ€™m starting a little journey to learn more about machine learning, as I try to generate music! As someone who loves listening to music, and has dabbled a little bit in using MIDI Files to create music on Logic Pro X, I created a LSTM model,  based on this Medium article, to train on my own electronic compositions and see what type of MIDI file is predicted and generated. I have already been able to generate a MIDI file from my compositions that is a bit random and not too pleasing to the ears, but I am working towards training the model to generate a MIDI file for a single instrument and combine such instruments to see the end result. By playing around with different instrument files and gathering individual data, I hope to improve how my LSTM generates music.
